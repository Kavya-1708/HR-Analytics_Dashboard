🌟 Unveiling Our HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI 🌟

I’m excited to share the HR Analytics dashboard I developed in Power BI, designed to give  valuable insights into employee trends, attrition, and satisfaction levels. Here’s how it helps  HR team make data-driven decisions:

📌 **Key Metrics at a Glance**: With Cards, we display the total count of employees, attrition numbers, attrition rate, average salary, average age, and average tenure. This overview is perfect for spotting high-level trends.

📉 **Attrition Over Time:** The line chart visualizes attrition trends by year, helping HR leaders identify any spikes and patterns over time.

📊 **Attrition by Job Role & Gender:** By analyzing attrition by job role (column chart) and gender (tree map), we can pinpoint specific roles or demographics with higher turnover rates.

📈 **Attrition by Salary, Age, and Education:** With column, bar, and donut charts, we can see how factors like salary, age group, and education level correlate with attrition, helping HR understand which groups are at higher risk of leaving.

🔄 **Employee Satisfaction by Department:** Our matrix chart gives an in-depth view of employee satisfaction levels across departments, highlighting areas that might need attention to improve retention.

🎛️ **Interactive Filters:** Using a department slicer, HR can filter and view attrition trends specific to each department, enabling more tailored analysis.

This dashboard has been instrumental in uncovering insights that support our people strategy and enhance the employee experience. Power BI's powerful data visualization makes it easier for HR to understand and act on complex data.
